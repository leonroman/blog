# Advantages and disadvantages and differences between #!/usr/bin/bash and #!/usr/bin/env bash

'#!/bin/bash' is a shebang line used in script files to set bash, present in the '/bin' directory, as the default shell for executing commands present in the file.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
It defines an absolute path /usr/bin/bash to the Bash shell. This is usually the default location of the Bash shell in almost all Unix-based operating systems.

The '#!/usr/bin/bash' shebang is recommended when we want to accurately point to an interpreter’s absolute path. It also has relatively high security, and we can pass additional parameters.

On the downside, it has poor portability because different systems can have interpreters installed in different locations. 
It can also be hard to remember the absolute path of all interpreters, especially in systems that have several interpreters installed, including python, zsh, csh, ksh, sh, and tcsh.


As we mentioned earlier,#!/usr/bin/env bash is also a shebang line used in script files to execute commands with the Bash shell.

It uses the env command to display the environment variables present in the system and then execute commands with the defined interpreter.

The env command works by instructing the system to look for the specified interpreter through the $PATH variable and use the first occurrence found. It’s located in the “/usr/bin/env” directory in Unix-based systems.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

Running script files through /usr/bin/env has the advantage of automatically searching for the default version of the interpreter in the current environment. 
This way, we don’t need to search for it in a specific location in the system, as the paths may be different in other systems.

The '#!/usr/bin/env' bash shebang offers more portability because we don’t have to write the absolute path to an interpreter.

However, it doesn’t support multiple parameters. This is because the declared interpreter and its option are parsed as one argument.

Additionally, it can be error-prone in instances where we have more than one version of an interpreter in our environment because it uses the first instance of bash found in $PATH.



Comparison
Here’s a table showing the comparisons between these shebang lines:

'#!/usr/bin/bash'
Offers more security
More specific, since we have to declare the exact path to an interpreter
Can support extra parameters passed after the declaration of the interpreter

'#!/usr/bin/env bash'
Offers more portability
Automatically searches for the first occurrence of an interpreter in the environment
Cannot support extra parameters because the system reads them as a single command


We can use either of them to execute commands in shell scripts with the Bash shell or any other shell. However, it’s recommended to use #!/usr/bin/bash when security is a priority and #!/usr/bin/env bash if we’re looking for portability.
